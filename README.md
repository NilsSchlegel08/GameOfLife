# Conway's Game of Life

This is a Java implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Swing for visualization. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

## Rules

The game follows these rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Features

- Random initial grid configuration.
- Visual representation of the grid using Swing.
- Start and stop the simulation with buttons.
